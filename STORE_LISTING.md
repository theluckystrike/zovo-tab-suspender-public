## FULL DESCRIPTION

```
Too many tabs open? Your browser is eating 4GB+ of RAM right now. Tab Suspender automatically suspends inactive tabs and gives that memory back instantly.

WHY THIS EXISTS

The Great Suspender was removed from Chrome Web Store for containing malware. Millions of users lost their favorite extension overnight. Tab Suspender Community Edition was built as the trustworthy replacement with the same workflow and same shortcuts but zero compromise on privacy.

HOW IT WORKS

Inactive tabs get suspended after your chosen timeout ranging from 5 minutes to 24 hours. Memory freed instantly. Click any suspended tab to restore it in milliseconds. Your scroll position and form data stay intact.

SMART PROTECTION

These tabs never suspend automatically

→ Tabs playing audio or video
→ Active video calls on Meet and Zoom and Teams
→ Tabs with unsaved forms
→ Your current active tab
→ Pinned tabs when enabled
→ Whitelisted sites like Gmail and Docs
